abstract: The neuropeptide oxytocin plays an evolutionarily conserved role in mammalian
  social behavior. Despite striking effects on animal social behavior after intracerebroventricular
  drug delivery, this delivery mode is impractical in humans. Intranasal oxytocin
  delivery provides a noninvasive alternative to increase central oxytocin activity,
  and has shown promise as a treatment for psychiatric illnesses. Intranasal oxytocin
  delivery is purported to increase central oxytocin concentrations via channels surrounding
  trigeminal and olfactory nerve fibers, which may facilitate increased activity at
  central oxytocin receptors. This report outlines the evidence for intranasal oxytocin
  delivery increasing central concentrations or activity, identifies current knowledge
  gaps and highlights future research opportunities. Recent efforts to enhance intranasal
  oxytocin delivery via improved intranasal delivery technology and dose-ranging studies
  are discussed.
